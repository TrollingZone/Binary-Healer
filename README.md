❌ **Permanently deleted files** cannot be recovered (no raw disk access)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No files found✅**
- Quick Scan only finds Recycle Bin files
- Try Raw Scan for permanently deleted files
- Files may be overwritten if disk was used heavily

**Permission denied✅**
- Right-click → Run as Administrator
- Raw/Sector scans require admin privileges

**Scan too slow✅**
- Click **Cancel Scan** for partial results
- Try Quick or Deep Scan instead

---

## 💻 Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- Administrator privileges (for advanced scanning)

---

## 📝 Tips

- **Act fast** - Scan immediately after deletion
