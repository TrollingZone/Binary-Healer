## 📖 Usage

2. Click **Raw Scan** (requires admin)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No files found✅**
- Quick Scan only finds Recycle Bin files
- Try Raw Scan for permanently deleted files
- Files may be overwritten if disk was used heavily

**Permission denied✅**
- Right-click → Run as Administrator
- Raw/Sector scans require admin privileges

**Scan too slow✅**
- Click **Cancel Scan** for partial results
- Try Quick or Deep Scan instead
