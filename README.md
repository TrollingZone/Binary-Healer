## 💡 What Can It Recover✅

### Local Drives (C:\, D:\, etc.):
✅ **Recycle Bin files** (95%+ success)  
✅ **Previous file versions** (70-90% if available)  
✅ **Permanently deleted files** (30-60% success via Raw/Sector scan)  
✅ **Multiple file types** (Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, etc.)

### Network Drives (P:\, Z:\, etc.):
✅ **Recycle Bin files** (95%+ success)  
✅ **Quick/Deep scans** work perfectly  
⚠️ **Raw/Sector scans** don't work (Windows limitation)  
❌ **Permanently deleted files** cannot be recovered (no raw disk access)

❌ **Cannot recover:** Overwritten data, formatted drives, physically damaged disks

## 📖 Usage

### Recently Deleted Files
1. Click **Quick Scan**
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Select files → **Recover Selected**

### Permanently Deleted (Shift+Delete)
1. Select the drive where files were deleted
2. Click **Raw Scan** (requires admin)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No files found✅**
- Quick Scan only finds Recycle Bin files
- Try Raw Scan for permanently deleted files
- Files may be overwritten if disk was used heavily

**Permission denied✅**
- Right-click → Run as Administrator
- Raw/Sector scans require admin privileges

**Scan too slow✅**
- Click **Cancel Scan** for partial results
- Try Quick or Deep Scan instead

---

## 💻 Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- Administrator privileges (for advanced scanning)

---

## 📝 Tips

- **Act fast** - Scan immediately after deletion
- **Stop using the drive** - Prevents overwriting
